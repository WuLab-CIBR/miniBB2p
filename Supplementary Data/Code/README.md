# miniBB2p_control
## Description
An application to control the miniBB2p, set the imaging parameter, and save the imaging data.
## System Requirements
### Hardware requirements
Details of specific hardware components of the miniBB2p are discussed in the associated publication:

> L. Qian *et al*, "High-throughput two-photon volumetric brain imaging in freely moving mice". [BioRXiv (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.13.618106)

A single computer workstation with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations is required for the application. 

For optimal performance, we recommend a computer with the following specs:
* RAM: 16+ GB
  
* CPU: 4+ cores, 3.3+ GHz/core
### Software requirements
* Matlab 2022a or more recent
  
* OS: The application has been tested on Windows 10(22H2) x64
## Installation
The app was written with Matlab 2022a, but should work with any newer version.

There are two ways to install/run the application:

* First way is to open with Matlab App Designer which gives you the right to modify the function.

* Second way is to install the app into the Matlab toolboxes which makes the most convinient way to call it. But you can not see or change the codes.

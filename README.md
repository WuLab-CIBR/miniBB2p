# miniature Bessel-beam two-photon microscope (miniBB2p)
## Description
This repository includes the optical design files, technical drawings, assembly protocol, and code for hardware control of miniBB2p. miniBB2p is a head-mounted miniature Bessel-beam two-photon microscope, published in Qian, et al.,"High-throughput two-photon volumetric brain imaging in freely moving mice (2024)". The miniBB2p is characterized by its lightweight design, reduced tethering stress, simple optics, and maximized fluorescence collection efficiency.

3) [Assembly protocol](https://github.com/WuLab-CIBR/miniBB2p/tree/main/Supplementary%20Data/Assembly%20protocol)

     This protocol includes all steps to assemble a miniBB2p headpiece. Each protocol starts with a short-list of main reagents and tools needed, followed by an overview schematic of the module, and a table with the main products.  2D drawings for custom components used in assembly setup are also attached.

4) [Code for hardware control](https://github.com/WuLab-CIBR/miniBB2p/tree/main/Supplementary%20Data/Code)

     An application to control the miniBB2p, set the imaging parameter, and save the imaging data. The application was written with Matlab.
